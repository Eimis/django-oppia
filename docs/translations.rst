Multilingual Interface and Content in the OppiaMobile App
===========================================================

For translating OppiaMobile, there are two separate areas to consider, the app 
interface and the course content.

App Interface
---------------

The language that the OppiaMobile app interface appears in (e.g. the buttons, 
menu items etc), is determined by translation files directly included and 
compiled into the app. Which language file is used is determined by the language
that the whole phone interface is set to. This will default to English if the 
phone is set to a language that Oppia does not have a language file for.

To add a new interface language, take copy of ``strings.xml`` from 
https://github.com/DigitalCampus/oppia-mobile-android/blob/master/res/values/strings.xml

Translate the English text (just the value, not the string name attribute).
